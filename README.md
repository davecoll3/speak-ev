# Speak EV

Speak EV is a crowdsourced dictionary of terms and jargon related to electric vehicles (EVs). The site allows any visiter to view the dictionary and for registered users to add their own terms to it. 

The primary technologies used to form the basis of this website are the coding languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Flask microframework. The forementioned were used in conjunction with the document based, non-relational database, MongoDB.

## Design

### Imagery
* An image of a Nissa Leaf EV charging was chosen as a hero image for the homepage. The Nissan Leaf was the world's first mass-market battery electric vechile (BEV) when it first arrived in 2010 and is now sold in 59 markets worldwide. It is an iconic vechile in the world of electric vehicles and was an obvious choice for visually demonstrating to the user that the site is related to EVs.

### Color Scheme

* Black (#000), white (#fff) and green (#76ff03) are the primary colors applied throughout the site. These are complemented by the use of various shades of grey (#bdbdbd, #eeeeee, #fafafa, #212121, #59595) red (#d50000, #ff1744) and blue (#1a237e, #1565c0). The main colors of black and white were chosen to provide a clean modern feel while providing excellent contrast. The green color was chosen as it is intrinsically linked to 'green' technologies while the bright lime shade was chosen to demonstrate the excitement of new EV technologies; all the while maintaining good contrast. Shades of grey are applied to provide definition from the background in such areas as the footer, forms, and on the collapsible text-area. They are also applied to text-input labels and to differentiate text in the collapsible text-area. Finally, shades of red are applied to the cancel and delete buttons while shades of blue are applied to text links; these were chosen in order to meet user expectations and existing conventions.

### Fonts

* The Google font of Rubik was chosen for the text throughout the site. It is from the sans serif font family with slightly rounded corners which give it a clean modern feel, in keeping with the overall site design asthetic. Additionally, the font is extremely ledgable providing good contrast in all colors and sizes.

### Structure

* The information architecture type used for this site is the hierarchical tree structure. This common structure allows for simple navigation throughout the site and allows for easy expansion of the site in the future. The use of the burger navigation icon, along with a floating return to top button, help to overcome the common issues with this structure on mobile devices.
