# Speak EV

Speak EV is a crowdsourced dictionary of terms and jargon related to electric vehicles (EVs). The site allows any visitor to view the dictionary and registered users to add their own terms to it. As EVs are a new and ever developing technology, it can be hard to keep up with all of the associated terms and acronyms. This is especially true for people adopting, or wishing to adopt, the technology for the first time. Speak EV aims to help demystify EV terms and jargon, making it accessible to all.

The primary technologies used to form the basis of this website are the coding languages HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, the Flask micro framework and template language Jinja. These were used in conjunction with the document based, non-relational database, MongoDB and deployed on Heroku.

## User Requirements and Expectations

### Requirements

  * Familiar and intuitive design that negates any learning curve.
  * A reactive site that is user friendly and well presented on all types of device and screen sizes.
  * Adequate levels of color contrast across the site that presents content in an accessible and easy to read manner.
  * Appealing visual presentation that enhances the user experience.
  * Full CRUD functionality
    * Create: registered users can create new dictionary terms.
    * Read: all users can read dictionary terms and definitions.
    * Update: registered users can update their own entries.
    * Delete: registered users can delete their own entries.

### Expectations

  * Feedback when interacting with the site that is also instructive.
  * Color choices for links and buttons should be familar and logical.

&nbsp;

## Design

### Imagery
* An image of a Nissa Leaf EV charging was chosen as a hero image for the homepage. The Nissan Leaf was the world's first mass-market battery electric vehicle (BEV) when it arrived in 2010 and is now sold in 59 markets worldwide. It is an iconic vehicle in the world of electric vehicles and was an obvious choice for visually demonstrating to the user that the site is related to EVs.

### Color Scheme

* Black (#000), white (#fff) and green (#76ff03) are the primary colors applied throughout the site. These are complemented by the use of various shades of grey (#bdbdbd, #eeeeee, #fafafa, #212121, #59595) red (#d50000, #ff1744) and blue (#1a237e, #1565c0). The main colors of black and white were chosen to provide a clean modern feel while providing excellent contrast. The green color was chosen as it is intrinsically linked to 'green' technologies while the bright lime shade was chosen to demonstrate the excitement of new EV technologies; all the while maintaining good contrast. Shades of grey are applied to provide definition from the background in such areas as the footer, forms, and on the collapsible text-area. They are also applied to text-input labels and to differentiate text in the collapsible text-area. Finally, shades of red are applied to the cancel and delete buttons while shades of blue are applied to text links; these were chosen in order to meet user expectations and existing conventions.

### Fonts

* The Google font of Rubik was chosen for the text throughout the site. It is from the sans serif font family with slightly rounded corners which give it a clean modern feel, in keeping with the overall site design aesthetic. Additionally, the font is extremely legible providing good contrast in all colors and sizes.

### Structure

* The information architecture type used for this site is the hierarchical tree structure. This common structure allows for simple navigation throughout the site and allows for easy expansion of the site in the future. The use of the burger navigation icon, along with a floating return to top button, help to overcome the common issues with this structure on mobile devices.

# Database

  MongoDB is a non-relational database that has a flexible data model. It was chosen as the database for this project as there are few relationships between the collections. This project consits of two collections, one for 'terms' and a second for 'users'. Within the collections each document has several key-value pairs, these are outlined in the data model image below.

  ![Data Model](readme-files/images/database-model.png)

&nbsp;

## Breakdown of Collections

### users
| Key      | Value    | Description                    |
|----------|----------|--------------------------------|
| _id      | ObjectId | primary key                    |
| username | String   | username chosen during sign-up |
| password | String   | werkzeug salted password hash  |

![Users Collection](readme-files/images/users-collection.png)


### terms
| Key              | Value    | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| _id              | ObjectId | primary key                                              |

* Main Heading Card

  * An image of a Nissa Leaf EV charging is used as a hero image, within the main heading card, on the homepage. It is an iconic vehicle in the world of EVs and was an obvious choice for visually demonstrating to the user that the site is related to EVs.

    ![Heading Card: Hero Image](/readme-files/images/feature-hero-image.png)

  * The main heading card also contains a < h1 > element, with a tagline for the site, which is followed by a line of text that provides a simple and concise description of the site's purpose. At the bottom of this section lies hyperlinked text which links to the sign-up page (for non registered users) or add term page (for registered users).

    ![Heading Card: Header and Text](/readme-files/images/feature-homepage-header.png)

* Search Panel

  * The search panel consists of a text-input field, where users can type their search word, which is followed by 'search' and 'reset' buttons. The text-input field is labelled, to indicate its purpose, and provides feedback to the user to ensure that they cannot submit an empty string. Search words can be submitted by an enter keypress or by selecting the 'search' button and reset by selecting the 'reset' button. 

    ![Search Panel](/readme-files/images/feature-search-panel.png)

* Homepage: Collapsible

  * The collapsible is used to display the term names and to show/hide the term definition; along with information regarding the user who submitted the term, the submission date and an alternative name for the term (if any). When a user selects a row on the collapsible, it reveals the term definition and a subsequent selection hides it again. If a secondary row is selected, when another row is already open, the new row will open while the previously selected row will be hidden. Additionally, the site admin will have access to two further buttons within the open collapsible, allowing them to edit and delete terms; registered users will only have these buttons shown for their own terms. These 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons link to the edit term page and a delete term modal respectively.

    ![Homepage: Collapsible](/readme-files/images/feature-homepage-collapsible.png)

* Profile: Header

  * The profile header contains a < h1 > element, consisting of the user's name, which is followed by an 'Add Term' button which links to the add term page.

    ![Profile: Header](/readme-files/images/feature-profile-header.png)

* Profile: Collapsible

  * The collapsible is used to display the term names and to show/hide the term definition; along with information regarding the user who submitted the term, the submission date and an alternative name for the term. Additionally, 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons are available to the user which link to the edit term page and a delete term modal respectively. On the profile page, the terms listed are just those created by the session user. When a user selects a row on the collapsible, it reveals the term definition and a subsequent selection hides it again. If a secondary row is selected, when another row is already open, the new row will open while the previously selected row will be hidden.

    ![Profile: Collapsible](/readme-files/images/feature-profile-collapsible.png)

* Edit Term Form

  * A page header sits above the edit term form, containing a < h1 > element, it informs the user of their location within the site. The edit term form auto populates with the information pertaining to the selected term. This information can be updated and submitted using the 'Edit Term' button. If the changes are valid, a flash message will appear at the top of the screen notifying them that the term has been successfully updated. Should the edited term match an existing term, or alternative name for an existing term, they will be redirected to the homepage and receive a flash message notifying them that the term, or alternative name, already exists within the dictionary.

    ![Edit Term Form](/readme-files/images/feature-edit-term.png)

* Delete Term Modal

  * Should the user, or admin, select the 'Delete' button, within the collapsible, a modal will appear. The main modal text will ask the user if they are sure that they want to delete the selected term. Beneath this, is text stating that this action cannot be undone. A 'Cancel' and a 'Delete' button sit in the modal footer with the former used to close the modal, without deleting the term, and the latter to confirm deletion. Should the deletion of the term be confirmed, they will be redirected to the homepage and a flash message will appear notifying the user that the term has been successfully deleted.

    ![Delete Term Modal](/readme-files/images/feature-modal.png)

* Add Term Form

  * A page header sits above the add term form, containing a < h1 > element, it informs the user of their location within the site. The add term form consists of two mandatory text-fields ('Term Name or Acronym' and 'Term Definition') and an optional text-field ('Alt Name'). The text-input fields are labelled, to indicate their purpose, and provide feedback to the user to ensure that they cannot submit an empty or invalid string. A complete form can be submitted using the 'add term' button. If the term name is valid, they will be redirected to the homepage and a flash message will appear at the top of the screen notifying them that the term has been successfully added to the dictionary. Should the new term match an existing term, or alternative name for a term, the add term form will reset to its default state and they will receive a flash message notifying them that the term already exists within the dictionary.

    ![Add Term Form](/readme-files/images/feature-add-term-form.png)

* Log-In Page

  * A page header sits at the top of the page containing a < h1 > element, it informs the user of their location within the site. The header is followed by two text-input fields for the user's 'username' and 'password' with a 'log in' button underneath. At the bottom of this section lies hyperlinked text which links to the log-in page, should the user be unregistered. The input fields are labelled, to indicate their purpose, and provide feedback to the user to ensure that they cannot submit an empty or invalid string. If the user details are valid, they will be redirected to the profile page and a flash message will appear at the top of the screen welcoming them. Should invalid user details be submitted, the user will receive a flash message notifying them of an incorrect username and/or password.

    ![Log In](/readme-files/images/feature-login-page.png)

* Sign-Up Page

  * A page header sits at the top of the page containing a < h1 > element, it informs the user of their location within the site. The header is followed by two text-input fields for the user's desired 'username' and 'password' with a 'Sign Up' button underneath. A line of text below the buttons to inform the user of the required password format. At the bottom of this section lies hyperlinked text which links to the sign-in page, should the user already be registered. The input fields are labelled, to indicate their purpose, and provide feedback to the user to ensure that they cannot submit an empty or invalid string. If the user details are valid, they will be redirected to the profile page and a flash message will appear at the top of the screen notifying them that they have successfully signed up. Should the user's desired username already exist, they will receive a flash message notifying them that the username already exists. 

    ![Log In](/readme-files/images/feature-sign-up-page.png)

* Flash Message

  * The flash messages consist of simple black text highlighted by a green background. The flash messages provide useful information/feedback to users and are located directly under the navbar for maximum visibility; the only exception to this is the 'No Results Found' flash message which appears underneath the search panel on the homepage.

    ![Footer](/readme-files/images/feature-flash-msg.png)

* Back to Top Button

  * A floating back to top button was used to allow the user an easy means of returning to the nav bar, this is especially important for mobile devices where the content is stretched vertically. The button appears when users scroll 70px from the top of the page.

    ![Back-to-Top Btn](/readme-files/images/feature-back-to-top-btn.png)

* Footer

  * The footer consists of copyright information and a mailto link which users can use to contact the site owner.

    ![Footer](/readme-files/images/feature-footer.png)


## Features to be Implemented in Future

* Pagination
  * As the dictionary expands, pagination would make for a better user experience as the number of terms could become tedious to browse if displayed on one page.

&nbsp;

* Categories
  * The addition of term categories would be useful for further dividing and organising dictionary terms. These categories could be added and updated by the site admin and would be selected from a drop-down menu when registered users are adding new terms.

&nbsp;

* Multiple Admins
  * It would be useful to have more than the one admin that is currently allowed. The addition of a boolean value would allow for this, with a key of 'is_admin'.

&nbsp;

* User and Admin authentication
  * In the future, it would be prudent to create a higher level of security and authentication regarding registered site users, and the site admin, as the current authentication is extremely rudimentary.

# Deployment

## Creating a Gitpod Repository

A GitHub repository is used to store your project, with Git and GitHub used for version control. The following steps outline how to create a GitHub repository.
  1. Log in to GitHub.
  2. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the '+' drop-down menu and select 'New repository'.
  3. Give your repo a short, memorable name.
  4. Choose your repository visibility; 'Public' or 'Private'.
  5. Select Initialize this repository with a README.
  6. Click Create repository.

&nbsp;

## Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub Repository makes a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account; allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository and can be done by using the following steps.
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository: [speak-ev](https://github.com/davecoll3/speak-ev).
  2. Once in the repository, navigate to the "Fork" button at the top right of the page; just above the settings button on the menu.
  3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

&nbsp;

## Making a Local Clone
  1. Log in to GitHub and locate the repository: [speak-ev](https://github.com/davecoll3/speak-ev).
  2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
  3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
  4. Open Git Bash
  5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
  6. Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
  ```

  7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
  > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
  > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
  > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
  > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)

## Heroku Deployment: Project Setup

If you don't have a Heroku account, or if you have yet to install the Heroku CLI, see [How to Install the Heroku CLI](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli) before you proceed.

  1. Make sure that your project is initialized as a Git repository. You can check this by running the following command at the root of your project.
  ```
  git status
  ```

  2. If you encounter an error, that means that your project isn't yet a Git repository. You can initialize the repository by running the following command.
  ```
  git init
  ```

  3. Applications that feature an Express.js back end can use Heroku's PORT environment variable. To set this up, create a port variable with a value of process.env.PORT. You can also add a default value for local instances of your server by using the || syntax.
  ```
  const port = process.env.PORT || 3001
  ```

## Heroku Deployment: Create a Heroku App

Now that you have created the repository and configured the server, you can create an app on Heroku. Using the steps below, this can be done without opening the browser.
  1. Create a new Heroku app by running the following command in the root of your project:
  ```
  heroku create
  ```

  2. The Heroku CLI will randomly generate an app name, but you can specify a name using the following syntax.
  ```
  heroku create <app name>
  ```

  3. Once you have created the app, you can run 'git remote -v' to verify that the Heroku remote URL was added by the Heroku CLI
  ```
  git remote -v
  heroku  https://git.heroku.com/<heroku-app-name>.git (fetch)
  heroku  https://git.heroku.com/<heroku-app-name>.git (push)
  ```

  4. The remote URL gets added automatically to your Git repository without requiring any extra commands. You can now prepare for deployment.

## Heroku Deployment: Deploy to Heroku

  1. Add and commit all your project files, then push to Heroku.
  ```
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Pushing to Heroku"
  git push heroku main
  ```

  2. Confirm that the application was deployed successfully by visiting the application URL provided in the terminal. Sometimes the output will say that the build was successful, but you should still open your application in the browser to verify.
  ```
  remote: -----> Build succeeded!
  remote: -----> Discovering process types
  remote:        Procfile declares types     -> (none)
  remote:        Default types for buildpack -> web
  remote:
  remote: -----> Compressing...
  remote:        Done: 33.8M
  remote: -----> Launching...
  remote:        Released v9
  remote:        https://lit-retreat-65972.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
  ```

  3. Your app should now be deployed with a server to Heroku. The link will be accessible as long as your app exists on Heroku.

If you encounter any issues, further details on Heroku deployment and troubleshooting can be found [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/heroku-deployment-guide).
